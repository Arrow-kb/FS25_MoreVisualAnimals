# FS25_MoreVisualAnimals

Standalone module from RealisticLivestock which just increases the max limit of visual animals to 200. Slider can be used to adjust the limit, accessed with Shift+T.

RealisticWeather has not been updated to be compatible with this yet and may cause issues when it is snowing.
